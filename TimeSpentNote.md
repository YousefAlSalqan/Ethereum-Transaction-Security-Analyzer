Tinme Spent:
2-3 hours per day for the past 3 weeks.
Before that I spent the time reading on Blockchain and Ethereum Transactions as I didn't have a background inEthereum transactions and their analysis. 


Shortcuts: 
Used ChatGPT for help with code generation, however I was simply guiding it and I was checking the code as I go.
